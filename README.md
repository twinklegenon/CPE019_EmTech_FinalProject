## 📌 About the Project

This project is a **Rock-Paper-Scissors Classifier** that uses a deep learning model to identify hand gestures from images. Developed with **TensorFlow** and deployed using **Streamlit**, this application allows you to upload an image of a hand gesture (rock, paper, or scissors) and have the model classify it accordingly.
